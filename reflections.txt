New features added:
1) Handled error scenarios
   * Error scenarios if customer not found in the find_by_name operation
   * Error corner case scenarios when creating transaction to check stock is in present
2) Added method to show order history of the customer

Time spent on this project
3-4 hours

3) Most rewarding challenge was to be able to serialize cusotmer object to json format. This involved nested array of objects

4) Still need to know more on usage of protected classes , ie to when to use, similar use cases
